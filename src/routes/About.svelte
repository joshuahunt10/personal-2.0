        Hi, my name is Josh and I am a web developer with a focus on frontend. In my previous professional life I was a chemist who worked in various roles and industries. I have since found a home working in mostly Javascript delivering user-centric applications with an eye on maintainability. Feel free to check out my <a class="about-resume-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CgUV619mNMSe0_enS2_9znGV6Y5M1CoT/view?usp=sharing" target="resume" title="Resume">resume</a> and send me an email with any inquiries!
